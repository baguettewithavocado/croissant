    <p>
      A croissant is a buttery, flaky, Austrian viennoiserie pastry inspired by
      the shape of the Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened
      laminated dough.

    <h3>Origin and history</h3>
    <p>
      The kipferl, the origin of croissant, can be dated back to at least the
      13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes. The kipferl can be
      made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the rugelach a
      form of kipferl). The birth of the croissant itself‚Äîthat is, its
      adaptation from the plainer form of kipferl, before the invention of
      viennoiseries‚Äîcan be dated to at least 1839 (some say 1838) when an
      Austrian artillery officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery
      ("Boulangerie Viennoise") at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris. This bakery,
      which served Viennese specialties including the kipferl and the Vienna
      loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and the
      concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie, a 20th-century term for
      supposedly Vienna-style pastries). The French version of the kipferl was
      named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has become a universally
      identifiable shape across the world. Sylvain Claudius Goy, a French chef,
      was the first to make croissant with yeast leavened laminated dough. Alan
      Davidson, editor of the Oxford Companion to Food, found no printed recipe
      for the present-day croissant in any French recipe book before the early
      20th century; the earliest French reference to a croissant he found was
      among the "fantasy or luxury breads" in Payen's Des substances
      alimentaires, 1853. However, early recipes for non-laminated croissants
      can be found in the 19th century and at least one reference to croissants
      as an established French bread appeared as early as 1850. Zang himself
      returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press magnate, but the bakery
      remained popular for some time afterwards, and was mentioned in several
      works of the time: "This same M. Zank ...founded around 1830 [sic], in
      Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise". Several sources praise this
      bakery's products: "Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in particular,
      the succulent products of the Boulangerie Viennoise"; "which seemed to us
      as fine as if it came from the Viennese bakery on the rue de Richelieu".
      By 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be mentioned as a
      breakfast staple, and in 1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in his periodical
      All the Year Round) of "the workman's pain de m√©nage and the soldier's
      pain de munition, to the dainty croissant on the boudoir table" The puff
      pastry technique that now characterizes the croissant was already
      mentioned in the late 17th century, when La Varenne's Le Cuisinier
      fran√ßois gave a recipe for it in the 1680 - and possibly earlier -
      edition. It was typically used not on its own but for shells holding other
      ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent). It does not appear to be mentioned in
      relation to the croissant until the 20th century.
